OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

================================================================================
2. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS - NOT AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS
================================================================================

⛔ THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPLICITLY NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION

The software is NOT designed for, intended for, or compliant with the laws of:
  - Russian Federation
  - Belarus
  - Any jurisdiction with mandatory encryption backdoor requirements
  - Any jurisdiction with telecommunications interception mandates
  - Any jurisdiction where use would violate local law

DO NOT USE, DEPLOY, OR DISTRIBUTE THIS SOFTWARE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS.

The creators EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT use of this software in any jurisdiction where:
  - Encryption registration/licensing is required
  - Government backdoor access to communications is mandatory
  - Data retention obligations apply to messaging platforms
  - The software would be classified as a "telecommunications operator"

================================================================================
3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY - EXPORT CONTROL NOTICE
================================================================================

This software contains strong cryptographic features including:
  - RSA-2048 encryption
  - TLS 1.2+ protocols
  - AES-256-GCM encryption
  - X.509 certificate-based authentication

EXPORT, IMPORT, OR USE MAY BE RESTRICTED OR PROHIBITED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES.

You are solely responsible for compliance with:
  - U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
  - Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls
  - EU Dual-Use Regulation
  - Local encryption import/export laws

================================================================================
4. NOT A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE - PEER-TO-PEER SOFTWARE
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: This software is PEER-TO-PEER communication software, NOT a messaging service.

**What this software is:**
  ✅ An experimental research project
  ✅ Educational proof-of-concept code
  ✅ Academic demonstration of P2P protocols
  ✅ Software that enables direct peer-to-peer communication
  ✅ A communication tool (like BitTorrent, VPN clients, or PGP)

**What this software is NOT:**
  ❌ A commercial telecommunications service
  ❌ A messaging service provider/operator
  ❌ A message relay or storage service
  ❌ Subject to telecommunications operator licensing
  ❌ Intended for production deployment
  ❌ Suitable for commercial use

**Critical Technical Distinction:**

TRADITIONAL MESSAGING SERVICES (WhatsApp, Telegram, VK):
  User A → Central Server (relays messages) → User B
  └─ Server sees, stores, and controls all messages
  └─ Service operator subject to telecommunications regulation

D-PC MESSENGER (P2P ARCHITECTURE):
  User A ←────────────────────────────→ User B
         Direct encrypted P2P connection

  Optional Hub (if using WebRTC):
  └─ Provides signaling only (connection setup)
  └─ Does NOT relay or store messages
  └─ Similar to STUN/TURN servers or BitTorrent trackers
  └─ Completely optional (Direct TLS works without Hub)

**Legal Implication:**

The creators do not operate:
  ❌ Message relay infrastructure
  ❌ Message storage services
  ❌ Telecommunications networks
  ❌ Messaging platforms

The creators provide:
  ✅ Peer-to-peer communication software (tool)
  ✅ Optional signaling infrastructure (connection facilitation only)

Users communicate directly with each other. The creators never control,
relay, or store user messages.
