## Purpose

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why do you need a CLA?

**A:** To enable multiple licensing (GPL/LGPL/AGPL + Commercial). Without your permission, we cannot offer commercial licenses that include your code.

### Q: Does this mean you'll close-source my code?

**A:** No! Your code will ALWAYS be available under GPL/LGPL/AGPL. The commercial license is an **additional** option for customers who need it.

### Q: Can I still use my code elsewhere?

**A:** Yes! You retain copyright and can use your code anywhere.

### Q: What if my employer owns my work?

**A:** You need:
1. Written permission from your employer, OR
2. Your employer signs a Corporate CLA

### Q: Can I revoke the CLA later?

**A:** No. The license grants are irrevocable. However:
- Your code remains under open-source license forever
- You can stop contributing at any time
- Your copyright remains yours

### Q: What about past contributions (before CLA)?

**A:** 
- For major contributors: we'll ask you to sign retroactively
- For minor contributions (typo fixes, docs): covered under implied license
- Uncertain cases: we'll contact you individually

### Q: Do project maintainers sign the CLA?

**A:** Yes! Everyone who contributes code signs the CLA, including core team.

### Q: What if I disagree with a commercial license sale?

**A:** The CLA gives the project right to make that decision. However:
- Core software remains open source (always GPL/LGPL/AGPL)
- Commercial licenses enable sustainable development
- Community governance decides major licensing changes

### Q: Is this similar to other projects?

**A:** Yes! Similar CLAs are used by:
- Apache Software Foundation
- Google (Chromium, Android, etc.)
- Microsoft (VS Code, TypeScript, etc.)
- Linux Foundation projects
- Qt (dual licensing model)

### Q: What about documentation contributions?

**A:** Documentation contributions generally don't require a CLA (they're under CC BY 4.0). However, if documentation includes code samples, CLA may be needed.
