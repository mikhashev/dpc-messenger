## The Vision: A Private Internet for Human-AI Collaboration

**The Immediate Problem:** AI is transforming how we work and think, but it's creating two critical failures:

1. **"Digital Debris"** — Endless chat histories where valuable insights get lost in noise. We need conversations that *extract permanent knowledge*, not create message archives.
2. **"Computational Inequality"** — Only people with powerful hardware (or expensive cloud subscriptions) can use advanced AI. We need *democratized access* through peer-to-peer compute sharing.

**D-PC Messenger solves both:**

- **Knowledge Commits** transform ephemeral conversations into structured, versioned knowledge (like git commits for your personal context)
- **P2P Compute Sharing** lets you borrow a friend's GPU to run powerful AI models — no cloud, no subscriptions, complete privacy
- **Context Collaboration** enables your AI assistants to work together by securely sharing relevant knowledge

**The Deeper Mission:** This isn't just productivity software. We're building infrastructure for **human-AI co-evolution** — ensuring humans can maintain cognitive parity as artificial general intelligence emerges.

Your personal context (conversations, insights, learned knowledge) should function like **"DNA for knowledge"** — portable across devices and lifetimes, evolvable through collaborative learning, owned and controlled by you (not extracted by corporations). In 10-20 years, when AI assistants from birth and brain-computer interfaces become mainstream, your accumulated "knowledge DNA" will determine your cognitive capacity in AI-augmented society.

We're racing against a closing window: the infrastructure being built TODAY will determine whether your future AI interactions are sovereign tools under your control, or rented products that extract and monetize your cognition.

## What is D-PC Messenger?

**D-PC Messenger** (Decentralized Personal Context) is a **privacy-first, peer-to-peer platform for human-AI collaboration**.

**The Core Idea:** Imagine you're working with your personal AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or local Ollama). Now imagine securely sharing relevant context with a trusted friend so *their* AI assistant can help too - without compromising privacy or relying on centralized servers.

**How it works:**
- **You + Your AI** - Chat with your personal AI assistant about anything
- **Collaborate with Humans** - Connect directly with trusted peers via encrypted P2P messaging
- **Share Context Securely** - Share conversation histories, documents, or knowledge with peers
- **Their AI Gets Smarter** - Your shared context helps their AI give better, more informed answers
- **Complete Privacy** - All data stays on your devices, encrypted end-to-end, with granular access control

**Real-world example:** You're researching a technical topic with your AI assistant. You share your conversation history with a colleague. Their AI can now see your research and provide complementary insights, creating a **collective intelligence** between humans and their AI assistants.

**Philosophy:** [Digital Self-Sovereignty](./docs/USER_SOVEREIGNTY.md) - Your data, your keys, your control. No backdoors, no data mining, no compromises.

                   6-Tier P2P Connection Fallback:
         IPv6 → IPv4 → WebRTC → UDP Hole Punch → Relay → Gossip
```

### Six-Tier Connection Fallback Architecture (v0.10.1)

D-PC Messenger uses intelligent fallback for near-universal P2P connectivity:

**Internet-Wide Strategies (No Hub Required):**
1. **IPv6 Direct** - Direct TLS over IPv6 (40%+ networks, no NAT, lowest latency)
2. **IPv4 Direct** - Direct TLS over IPv4 (works locally or internet-wide with port-forwarding)

**Hub-Assisted Fallback:**
3. **WebRTC** - STUN/TURN NAT traversal via Hub signaling (when direct methods fail)

**DHT-Based Fallback (Hub-Independent):**
4. **UDP Hole Punch** - DHT-coordinated, DTLS encrypted (60-70% NAT success)
5. **Volunteer Relay** - Privacy-preserving relay nodes (100% NAT coverage)
6. **Gossip Store-Forward** - Eventual delivery for disaster scenarios (in progress)

**Key Benefits:**
- Hub completely optional for Priorities 1-2, 4-6
- Automatic fallback ensures connectivity in nearly any network condition
- DTLS encryption for all 6 strategies

### Important: True Peer-to-Peer Architecture

**D-PC Messenger is NOT a messaging service.** It is peer-to-peer communication software.

**What this means:**
- ✅ Messages are transmitted **directly between users** via encrypted P2P connections
- ✅ The creator does **NOT operate message relay infrastructure**
- ✅ The creator does **NOT store or transmit user messages**
- ✅ The creator does **NOT control user communications**

**Hub Architecture:**
- Provides WebRTC signaling for NAT traversal (like STUN/TURN servers)
- Messages flow directly P2P between clients (Hub never sees content)
- Direct TLS connections work independently of Hub for local networks
- Hub-free operation mode planned for Phase 3 (DHT-based discovery)

**Legal implication:** This software provides a communication tool, not a communication service. Users are solely responsible for their use of this software and any infrastructure they choose to deploy.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.12+ with Poetry
- **Node.js** 18+ with npm
- **Rust** (install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Docker** (for Hub database)

### Option 1: Local Testing (No Hub)

Test Direct TLS connections on your local network:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Client 1
cd dpc-client/core
poetry install
poetry run python run_service.py

# Terminal 2: Start UI for Client 1
cd dpc-client/ui
npm install
npm run tauri dev

# Repeat for Client 2 on another machine (same network)
# Connect using dpc:// URI displayed in the app
```

### Option 2: Full Setup with Hub (WebRTC)

Enable internet-wide connections:

**1. Start the Hub:**
```bash
cd dpc-hub
docker-compose up -d              # Start PostgreSQL
cp .env.example .env              # Configure (edit SECRET_KEY)
poetry install
poetry run alembic upgrade head   # Run migrations
poetry run uvicorn dpc_hub.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```

**2. Start the Client:**
```bash
cd dpc-client/core
poetry install
poetry run python run_service.py

# In another terminal
cd dpc-client/ui
npm run tauri dev
```

**3. Authenticate and Connect:**
- Login via OAuth (Google or GitHub) in the UI
- **NEW:** Client automatically registers cryptographic node identity
- Enter peer's `node_id` in the UI
- Click "Connect via Hub"
- WebRTC automatically establishes a direct P2P connection

**4. Secure Your Data (Recommended):**
```bash
# Create encrypted backup of your .dpc directory
cd dpc-client/core
poetry run python -m dpc_client_core.cli_backup create

# Your backup is saved to ~/dpc_backup_TIMESTAMP.dpc
# Store it on USB drive or encrypted cloud storage
```

**See [docs/QUICK_START.md](./docs/QUICK_START.md) for detailed instructions.**
**Backup guide: [docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md](./docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md)**
**GitHub OAuth: [docs/GITHUB_AUTH_SETUP.md](./docs/GITHUB_AUTH_SETUP.md)**

---

## Production Deployment

### Deploy Hub to VPS

For production use, deploy the Hub on a public server:

```bash
# On your VPS (Ubuntu 22.04+)
git clone https://github.com/mikhashev/dpc-messenger.git
cd dpc-messenger/dpc-hub

# Configure production settings
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add production credentials (SECRET_KEY, OAuth, etc.)

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Set up Nginx + SSL
# See docs/WEBRTC_SETUP_GUIDE.md for complete instructions
```

**Full guide: [docs/WEBRTC_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./docs/WEBRTC_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

---

## Authentication & Security

### Authentication Flow (v0.6.0)

1. **OAuth Login** - User authenticates via **Google or GitHub** ([setup guide](./docs/GITHUB_AUTH_SETUP.md))
2. **Temporary Node ID** - Hub assigns temporary ID
3. **Cryptographic Registration** - Client registers public key & certificate
4. **Verified Identity** - Hub validates and marks node_id as verified
5. **JWT Token** - Client receives JWT for API access
6. **Logout Support** - Tokens can be blacklisted upon logout

### Security Features

- End-to-end encryption (DTLS in WebRTC, TLS in Direct)
- **Client-side encrypted backups** - AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (600k iterations)
- Cryptographic node identities (derived from RSA public keys)
- Context firewall (.dpc_access.json) for granular permissions
- JWT authentication with Hub (token blacklisting supported)
- No message persistence by default
- Node identity validation (certificates, public keys)
- **No backdoors** - If you lose your passphrase, data is permanently unrecoverable (by design)
